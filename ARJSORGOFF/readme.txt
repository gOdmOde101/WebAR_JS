1.index.html works well using the default HIRO marker.
2.index2.html works well to,using the given example from a-frame website(cube,sphere,cylinder scene example).
3.index3.html(attempt to put custom model and marker instead of HIRO and TREX) doesn't functions as it may have some bugs in codingng.needs to be fixed.
4.index4.html takes too much time to load scrren.
5.image-based is ripped-of directly from the official doc,but isnt functioning. Even though loading screen is passed,but still.
6.index6.html workes SUCCESSFULLY.Problem was with raw.githack.com URL for the asset folder.Fixed it from RAW.GITHACK.COM website and it worked. NEXT STEP-> applying different custom marker. adding UI element and interaction to models. Animated model. using QRcode with marker for hasel-free experience

 1.custom pattern proves to be a lil difficult to pull out.
 2.image used seems to be having a thinner outer black border as compared to HIRO marker.
 3.need to put the URL properly for marker.
 4.If all else fails....going for pattern marker.
